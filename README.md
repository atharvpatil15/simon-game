# 🎮 Simon Game (JavaScript Version)

A simple and interactive memory-based **Simon Game** created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

> 🧑‍💻 **Note:** The base structure and core logic of this project were created entirely by me. I used AI to help enhance the design and improve the visual appeal, but the functionality and code logic were written by hand as a learning exercise.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. Press **any key** to start the game.
2. Watch the flashing button sequence carefully.
3. Click the buttons in the **same order** as they were flashed.
4. If you get it right, a new button gets added to the pattern.
5. If you click the wrong button — ❌ Game Over!

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

This project was created **especially to understand and apply core JavaScript concepts** like:

- DOM manipulation
- Event listeners
- Arrays and pattern logic
- setTimeout for animations
- Conditional logic and game flow

It’s a hands-on way to deepen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and user input.

## 🧠 Game Logic Overview

- `arr1` stores the **game-generated button pattern**.
- `arr2` stores the **user's clicked pattern**.
- Every round, the game adds a new button to `arr1`.
- The user must repeat the full pattern in the correct order.
- One wrong click resets the game.
